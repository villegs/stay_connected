## **App for Aggregated Health Metrics Reporting**

This application is designed to streamline the aggregation and analysis of weekly health metrics across multiple centers in Chile. Given the lack of a unified backend and standardized data-sharing protocols in the Chilean healthcare system, our app provides a solution to efficiently collect, process, and interpret aggregated metrics without handling any personally identifiable information (PII).

### **How It Works**

The app utilizes advanced language models to interpret free-form text reports submitted by various health centers. These reports, which typically vary in structure and format, are processed by **Gemini**, an LLM-based engine that translates the unstructured data into actionable tables. Gemini intelligently identifies key metrics, normalizes the data, and generates structured outputs that can be easily integrated into dashboards and other reporting tools.

### **Key Features**

- **PII-Free Aggregation**: Focuses on collecting and processing only aggregated metrics to ensure privacy and compliance with data protection standards.
- **Flexible Data Input**: Supports diverse report formats and allows for manual filtering and custom report generation.
- **Cross-Center Analysis**: Enables the comparison and visualization of data across multiple centers, providing insights at both city and national levels.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Offers a configurable dashboard where users can view, compare, and analyze key health metrics.
- **Actionable Insights**: By translating raw reports into structured tables, the app facilitates data-driven decision-making within the healthcare system.

This app is a step forward in addressing the challenges of decentralized health data management in Chile, empowering health systems with the tools they need to make informed decisions based on accurate and timely information.
